It was a group project worked on from September 23rd, 2019 to October 6th, 2019. The main topic was changed from baseball to riddles, American history, and math. To clarify, more subjects were added so users could had choices. Furthermore, its old name, "QuizMe", was replaced with "Test Your Knowledge!" A scoring system was created to give results of the quiz. Some questions were given pictures related to them.</p>

Our objective was to create a game from Scratch. The product turned out to be a game where the user has to survive through levels against obstacles. Power-ups that give special abilities are randomly spawned and can be picked up by the user. As they progress further in, speed increases and a final boss awaits them at the last level.</p>
