            <p style="color: white;">Hi, my name is Calvin Kwong and I'm currently in 9th grade attending Dublin High School. This is my online engineering portfolio. It contains information all about me, my past projects in Computer Science Principles, education, and beyond! I first became interested in coding and programming in middle school. I decided to take an elective for computer science. At the beginning, it was boring and confusing, but then I began to understand what I was supposed to do and enjoyed it. To elaborate, I got interested in computer science. I am now enrolled in CSP because I want to continue to pursue this path at least for now. </p><p style="color: white;">I currently have some experience in the languages: HTML, CSS, and Python. My plan is to go in depth learning those programming languages and others along with it like JavaScript. A hobby I've been picking up recently is cooking. I find it enjoyable and eating the food is even more so. The quarantine from COVID-19 has made things pretty boring but it gives me a chance to read books and do other activities at home.</p><p style="color: white;">Completed CSP projects can be found in the Projects page and more information about me is in the Resume page. If you want to contact me, my email is listed in Contact Me.</p>
